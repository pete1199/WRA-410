## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.<br>
- For this requirement I changed the Resources html page, I changed the background color, switched the font to a google font and I made changes to the nav bar so it would be white until it hits the footer.

2. Use a new font.
- I used a google font for the text on the Resources html page.

3. Include two images.
- I included the sublime and atom logos on the Resources html page.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
- I created a basic table comparing GPA to possible points.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
- I created a grid fro the student groups, changed the link colors to white and added the correct titles.

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.
- I created a nav bar underneath the header.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
- I wanted the middle column to be centered right under the nav bar so everything looked like it was in place and symmetric. I changed the columns to be set up as a 30% 40% 30%.
